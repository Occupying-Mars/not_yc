# YC Startup MVPs in Under an Hour

This repository contains minimal viable products (MVPs) of Y Combinator startup ideas that I've recreated in under an hour each. These are mostly startups that are not opensource

## Disclaimer
This is a personal project done in my free time. I have no affiliation with any of the companies listed here and mean no offense to these companies or their products.

## About
Each folder contains:
- A basic MVP implementation of the core app functionality
- A Streamlit web interface where applicable
- Individual README documentation
- in some cases a media folder containing example outputs

## Status
This is an ongoing project. More MVPs will be added as they are built.
if you want a specific mvp added to the repo add an issue or feel free to dm me on [X](https://x.com/OccupyingM)
